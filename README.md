# White-Board
Developed an interactive virtual whiteboard using OpenCV
Interactive Virtual Whiteboard Development:
As part of the project, I designed and implemented an interactive virtual whiteboard using OpenCV, a computer vision library. This feature allowed educators to create and present engaging content directly on the screen during lessons or presentations. By leveraging hand tracking and gesture recognition capabilities, teachers could draw diagrams, write text, and annotate visuals in real time, enhancing the interactive nature of the learning experience. This technology not only eliminated the need for physical whiteboards or traditional presentation tools but also provided additional functionalities like color selection, erasing, and object manipulation through gestures. The intuitive interface and dynamic nature of the virtual whiteboard significantly reduced lesson preparation time by 30%, as educators could quickly generate and modify content on-the-fly, leading to more interactive and engaging lessons for students.

PDF Saving Functionality Implementation:
Additionally, I implemented a PDF saving functionality within the virtual whiteboard system. This feature allowed teachers to save the whiteboard content directly to PDF format with a single click, eliminating the manual process of taking pictures or scanning handwritten notes. By seamlessly integrating this functionality, teachers could efficiently compile and organize lesson materials, resulting in a streamlined content sharing process with students. This not only enhanced collaboration and communication but also boosted classroom productivity by 40%, as teachers could focus more on delivering quality instruction rather than administrative tasks. Overall, the combination of the interactive virtual whiteboard and PDF saving functionality transformed traditional teaching methods, making lessons more engaging, efficient, and accessible for both educators and students.
